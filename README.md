# Introduce
Life Explorer is a mobile-based application that offers a platform for residents and travellers to discover events held within Brisbane.

Users are prompted to select an adjective that best describes the day they would like to have. This then generates a list of events that are correlated with that adjective in the eyes of those who previously attended them. The application also enables storytelling about events, allowing event-seekers to understand (and later experience) the city of Brisbane from a new set of eyes.

To create Life Explorer, we have hacked the datasets from the Brisbane City Council in order to retrieve information on the events that are held in Brisbane.
